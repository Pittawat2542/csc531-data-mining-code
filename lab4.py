# CSC531/BIF633/INT382 -- Week#4 Lab -- Proximity measures (Distance & Similarity)
# by...Chakarida NUKOOLKIT
#
# Instruction:    
#
# 1) Try to edit the given code with other proximity parameters such as 'cityblock', 'cosine'
# 'euclidean', 'manhattan', 'hamming', 'jaccard', 'mahalanobis', 'chebyshev', 'canbera', 'matching', ...
# 2) Guess/manually calculate the result
# 3) Run your code and compare the result
#
#
#  Question: Before you execute a run  of a new proximity measure, guess what you will get before you run it by 
#            manually calculate the outcome.  If Python returns different answer than yours, ask yourself why !!!
#
#  Challenge#1:  Try to change the value of your data, manually calculate the output measure, then execute your coresponding 
#                code and compare results with your previous manual calculation
#
#  Challenge#2:   Can you make a scatter plot of the given data before computing variety of distances/similarity measures
